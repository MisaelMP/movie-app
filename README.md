# movie-app
Vue 3 app using vite, tailwindcss, vuex, postcss, and open source API.

# What
I created this application using the latest version of vue (vue 3) at the time and vite as a hmr.
My aim was to demostrate a clean architecture, DRY and a single source of truth to store the data with vue. I used a css methodlogy called BEMIT to create readeable
contextual components and tailwind for quick prototyping. 
It is not fully responsive for the time frame, but I think it demostrate the use of a developer friendly experience.

# Installation
Get the repo and run npm install, you may have to check for the latest version of node to be able to run it.

# Caveats
You may need to install the beta version of vue js tools to inspect the DOM.
